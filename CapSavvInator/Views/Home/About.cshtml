<p>
    CapSavvInator is a modified version of <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r29128976-CapSavvy-v4.3-released-" target="_blank">CapSavvy</a>, 
    which is described by the author as "a tool that can retrieve your data transfer usage from most independent ISPs and display it in your system tray".
</p>
<p>
    So basically I took the "meat" of CapSavvy, which are the modules that request and parse data from the various ISPs, and
    placed that into the website you're looking at right now.  In other words, the author of CapSavvy did all the hard work, and 
    I'm just displaying the data in a different way (on this website, instead of in your system tray).
</p>
<p>
    ISPs currently supported by CapSavvy (and hence CapSavvInator) are:
    <ul>
        <li>Caneris</li>
        <li>Electronicbox</li>
        <li>Start</li>
        <li>TekSavvy</li>
        <li>Videotron</li>
    </ul>
